Yeah, of course I used the backdoor to the factory, that's the closest entrance to the
freezer and I brought in some ingredients that can't really stand the heat.

At the time of the murder I was at a block party right down the street from here, we threw
the party for one of the neighbors who got back from the hospital after an accident. I was
with my kids. You can ask anyone who's been there.

Oh wait, you know what? We took a picture... Let me get my phone.

See? That's me, that's the neighbor, here's my little girl. And you see the timestamp?

So yeah, I really don't have anything to do with that... Barely knew the victim...

But you know what? I did see someone rushing out of the factory... He got into a green Hyundai,
you don't see many of those around here... Probably a rental. I didn't catch his face, was just
weird seeing someone running off like that... Come to think about it, maybe that person had
something to do with it?

Anyways, best of luck catching whoever did it!
